# Mumbai-Railway-Network

This repository contains mumbai railway network stations as a git graph.    <br />

One might ask why? Well why not. I think this is one of the way to learn git branches.   <br />
The railway network can be consider as graphs, Which is kind of same as the software version control. The commit in this repository are nothing but empty commits it represents the station
names and appropriate branches are created by using the commit hash of the commits that has be done.    <br />

The main branch is where i have used for any files or documentation related to this repository. <br />
There are 2 files naming currently naming command.txt and information.txt.  <br />

information.txt : This contains all the station names that i have simply taken from wikipedia for varoius lines.    <br /> 
command.txt : This contain the git commands that i have used to create this network. <br />

Take a look at the network graph of this repository:-   <br />

This git network graph is still far from perfect and can contains lots of mistakes like merge 2 or 3 branches to make be some station names or lines.   <br />
